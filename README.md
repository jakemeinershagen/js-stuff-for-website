# Astro Tools

Tools for astronomy. Especially amateur astronomers. Will be posted on [my website](jakemeinershagen.com/astronomy) at some point.


# ToDo:
- Allow adding multiple eyepieces and calculate mag and fov for each.
    - make sure not entering barlow is allowed
- Resolution limits for scope.
- Allow entering focal length or focal ratio (note that focal length should be prefered)
- CSS to make it look okay. Especially necessary is centering the table info and adding borders

## Maybe List
- Overlay fov on an object like Andromeda.
